# ML-from-scratch
It is fun to implement things from scratch isn't it? It helps understand where it all began

I have implemented:
1. Fisher's LDA
2. Naive Bayes
3. Logistic Regression
4. SVM using Lagrange Dual problem
5. SVM using Pegasos considering hinge loss and softplus loss at a time (using projected gradient descent,
   mini-batch gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent)
6. Adaboost algorithm - naive version where I decide which weak learner to be removed during each iteration of the algorithm
   so that the next best weak learner get's picked up in each current iteration
7. Decision stump - level 1 decision tree
